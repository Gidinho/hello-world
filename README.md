Tutorial
I've just started my PhD in Tropical Diseases and I really think that if I do it right, I am going to get cool opportunities around the world. Coding might be my key to the life I desire, with enough payment, interesting people, interesting places, knowledge and all. I am hopefull and excited.
Oh, and, my gf said some stuff about me behaving in weird ways and making her back up on plans with me. That might be a problem... or not?
IDK, I feel like now is time for me to focus on my career, since I've been not really up to my feet the past two years, kind of allowing life to take me. Not I feeel like I got to take life where I wanna go. Weird saying all this nonsense stuff, without really objective messages, but, these are important insights I've been having. 
So... I can use different lines here then? 
Cool.
